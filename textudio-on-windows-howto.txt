# Steps to use miktex+texStudio on Windows

## Install required packages

1. Install the latest version of miktex (https://www.miktex.org). Select install required packages on the fly (either "Yes" or "Ask me first")

1.1 Run MiKTeX Console and "Check for updates" (otherwise you'll probably get an error when compiling LaTeX sources)

1.2 In MiKTeX Console, run Updates|Update now


2. Install the latest version of TexStudio (https://www.texstudio.org/)

3. Install a perl interpreter. I used Strawberry perl from https://strawberryperl.com/, but you can go to the perl site (https://www.perl.org/get.html) and check other alternatives.

4. Configure it to use biber as the bibliography processor:
   Options > Configure TeXstudio > Build > Default Bibliography > Biber


## Generate the "book" (main document)

1. Open `book.tex` in the `Book` directory of the template distribution
2. Press "Compile & View" and it should work flawlessly (MiKTeX will be in charge of downloading any required package on the fly, provided you told it so in the installation process)


## If you use glossaries

1. Run makeglossaries from the "Tools|Glossary" menu entry
2. Press "Compile & View" again.
