Notes on what I have installed on windows to compile the templates
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

+ miktex (tell it to automatically install what it needs)

+ texstudio

+ github desktop

+ Follow advice at https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/156270/has-anyone-managed-to-use-glossaries-with-texstudio-on-windows

+ It compiles perfectly for me, even with acronyms and such, without touching absolutely nothing.


  Enjoy!!
